# Here's some notes I found from Buterin's keynote speech on "State of the Onion - Smart Contracts for Smart Nations"

- Way to identify "faulty" or "unsafe" contract:

While generating random number putting your seed in a private method doesn't mean the world can't see it. Your contract is in a public blockchain.

Variable mixups:
Ex: payoutCursor_Id_ & payoutCursor_Id are differnt things 

How do we avoid such things?
